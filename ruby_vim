Ruby: Text objects ~
Vim's |text-objects| can be used to select or operate upon regions of text
  that are defined by structure.  The vim-ruby plugin adds text objects for operating on methods and classes.

am  ---  "a method", select from "def" until matching "end" keyword.

im  ---  "inner method", select contents of "def"/"end" block, excluding the "def" and "end" themselves.

aM  ---  "a class", select from "class" until matching "end" keyword.

iM  ---  "inner class", select contents of "class"/"end" block, excluding the "class" and "end" themselves.
