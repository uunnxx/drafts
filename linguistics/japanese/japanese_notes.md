## GODAN verbs:
If you're still confused, here are some notes on GODAN verbs (everything that doesn't end in -ERU or -IRU).
So the form you find in a dictionary always ends in the letter U, "Yomu" ( to read) for example. If we want:
- A polite form, we replace the final u with "imasu". Yomu -> YomIMASU, yomIMASEN, yomIMASHITA., etc.
- Negative form, we replace the final u with "anai". Yomu -> YomANAI. If the word has a vowel before the last U, the U is replaced by "wanai" instead. "Kau -> kaWANAI".
These rules are the same for pretty much every godan verb (although exeptions propably exist).

As for te-form:
- Verbs that end in -U, -TSU or -RU use -TTE.
- Verbs that end in -NU, -BU or -MU use -NDE.
- Verbs that end in -KU use -ITE. -GU becomes -IDE.
- Verbs that end in -SU use -SHITE.
If you replace the last -E with -A, it changes the verb from te-form to casual past form.
And if you're struggling to remember all of this, just mash it all together and think "Utsurutte & Nubumunde. Kuite, guide, sushite". Hope this helps someone.



- what is the purpose of te form ?
- te form is used when you want to join the verb with other words. for example:
ganbatte-kudasai
