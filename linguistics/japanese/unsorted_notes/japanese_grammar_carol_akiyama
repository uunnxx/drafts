## VOWELS

### Macrons[:meaning]

A macron [bar] above a vowel means it should be lengthened.

- Long vowels are important. Pronouncing a long vowel incorrectly can result in
  a different word or even an unintelligible one.

  - obasan (oh-bah-sahn)  : aunt
  - obAsan (oh-bAH-sahn)  : grandmother

  - ojisan (oh-jee-sahn)  : uncle
  - ojiisan (oh-jEE-sahn) : grandfather

  - seki (seh-kee)        : seat
  - seiki (sEH-kee)       : century

- Sometimes the 'i' and the 'u' aren't pronounced. This usually occurs between
  voiceless consonant.
  - sukiyaki (skee-yah-kee)
      This word for a popular Japanese dish begins with 'skee', not 'soo'.
      The 'u' in not pronounced.

  - tabemashita (tah-beh-mahsh-tah) : I ate
      The 'i' is not pronounced.

## CONSONANTS

With a few exceptions, Japanese consonants are similar to those of English.
Note those that are different:

  - f: The English 'f' is pronounced with a passage of air between the upper teeth
      and the lower lip. To make the Japanese 'f', blow air lightly between your lips
      as if you were just beginning a whistle.

  - g: Always as in 'go', never as in 'age'. You may also hear it pronounced as
      the 'ng' sound in sing but not at the beginning of a word.

  - r: This is different from the English 'r'. To make the Japanese 'r', lightly
      touch the tip of your tongue to the bony ridge behind the upper teeth, almost
      in the English 'd' position. It's more like the Spanish 'r', but its' not trilled.

  - s: Always hissed, as in so, never voiced, as in his or pleasure.
