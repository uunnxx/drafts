えらそう　に！！ 　        自分　      は　     どう  　な  の   　えーつ！！
air of importance with     yourself    as-for   how     (exlp. ?)  Huhh ?
You talk like an authority, but how about yourself? Huh ? (PL2)

- **urusai!** when spoken sharply is equivalent to English "Shut up! / Be quiet!" **wa** is a colloquial
particle used mostly by women, and **ne** in this case serves as emphasis: "You sure are noisy" => "Shut up! / Be quiet!"
- ***ki ni itta** is the past form of **ki ni iru, an expression meaning "to like / be pleased with."
  **Ki ni itta mono** = "things I am / you are pleased with"
- **erasO** is the adjective **erai** ("eminent / important [person]") with the suffix **-sO** indicating
  "an air / appearance of", so **erasO ni** implies "[act / speak] with an air/appearance of importance/authority."
