In anime and comics, you may have seen unfamiliar Kanji letters used for numbers - "第壱話 [Episode 1]" for example.

These Kanji letters are called Daiji 大字 - formal numbers.

大字 is used in legal and financial documents to prevent manipulation (e.g. adding two horizontal bars to 一 [one] becomes 三 [tree]).

In anime, 大字 is used to give eccentric taste.
