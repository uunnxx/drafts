## The Basics

### Pronunciation Guide

#### What are **vowels** and **consonants**

There are two kinds of sounds in any language.

- **Vowels** are produced by air passing out through the mouth without being blocked.
  The letters that present these sounds are **a i u e o**

- **Consonants**, on the other hand, are produced by blockage (partial or complete) of the air.
  The remaining alphabet letters are used to represent consonant sounds: k, s, t, b, c, d, etc.
