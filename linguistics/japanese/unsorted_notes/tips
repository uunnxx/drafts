Small Hiragana / katakana characters:
  - Try typing an x before whatever kana you want small, like xtsu and xa give you っ and ぁ.
  - Most of the time you don't need to type っ at all. If you double the consonant of the following character it will be added automatically, e.g. かった is typed as 'katta',やっぱり is 'yappari'
