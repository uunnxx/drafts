A BETTER TRANSLATION:

Come! From your love, I have lost my mind. 
If I were a townsman, I am a vagabond now.   
For your love, I let go of family and home. 
to dwell now in the pain of loving you.  
I was so weak, that I am sad to describe, 
but when I saw you I became strong. 
As your soul mingled with mine, 
for you, from others I cut all my ties.  
Day and night I told legends of other lovers
Now in your love, I have become one.

Instrumental.

On those intoxicated with love, I swear: I am intoxicated with your love.  
Take my hand, oh pure and beautiful love.
On those who give up their life for love, I swear. 
On those who are free and joyous, I swear. 
Once I was just a bookkeeper
but now I preside over poets. 
Once I saw divine light reflected in the cupbearer (cupbearer is symbolic for an enlightened spiritual master), 
I became intoxicated and I broke all pens. (Rumi believed that written language does not do justice to love)

Instrumental. 

You told me to tear down the veil, which I did. (veil is symbolic for whatever prevents you from seeing divine light).
You told me to shatter the cup, which I did. (The cup is symbolic. Compared to the wine of love, the cup is worthless) 
You told me to let go of all my companions, which I did,
and then I clung to you. 
I detached my heart from all others 
and made it hold onto you. 

Note:
Rumi was not a romance writer. All references to wine, intoxication, cup, cupbearer, light, veil, etc are all metaphors for spiritual realities. He sought to enlighten the world through his poetry so that love and peace would spread in the world. Poetry was the means to an end, not the end itself. :)
