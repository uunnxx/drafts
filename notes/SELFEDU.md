Гордость Поимеет Всех

You're Better off Starting Imperfectly than to be Paralyzed by the Delusion of Perfection

Experience Makes You Attractive

Experiment While You Have Time to Spare
Be Really Good at What You Do

Learn by Yourself
Build Network
Don't Look for Shortcuts 
Don't Compare Yourself with Smarter Programmers

Build Lots and Lots of Things (Practice, Practice, Practice)

Learning for Whole Life (applies on almost everything)
Get Comfortable with Being Uncomfortable
It's OK to not Know Things

When you Pretend to be Smart, Nobody Learns Anything
Be Brave Enough to be Bad at Something new

Don't Judge Someone You Don't Care About
A Man who Stands for Nothing will fall for Anything
